    <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
    <p>
      With over 20 years of experience in the software development industry, I've witnessed the evolution of numerous
      technologies and methodologies—adapting and contributing to each phase with enthusiasm and resilience. My journey
      began at <b>Sysline</b>, a small but agile company where I laid a strong technical foundation. The nimbleness of
      the organization enabled us to quickly adopt emerging tools and methodologies. It was here that my interest in
      <b>Agile software development</b> first took root, including early exposure to <b>Extreme Programming (XP)</b>
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I later joined <b>Ixonos</b>, where I contributed to cross-platform mobile development efforts—spanning
      <b>Symbian</b>, <b>Linux</b>, and <b>Windows Phone</b> ecosystems. Over time, I served in various capacities, from
      software developer to <b>architect and team lead</b>, driving innovation across different verticals and scaling
      both teams and systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeking a deeper technical role, I transitioned to <a hre href="https://samlink.fi/" target="_blank">Samlink</a>, immersing myself
      in a new domain and embracing a developer-centric focus. This pivot reinvigorated my passion for hands-on
      problem-solving and technical excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.aidon.com/" target="_blank">Aidon</a>, I serve as both <em>Solution Architect</em> and <em>Platform
        Leader</em>, spearheading initiatives that harness <em>modern cloud-native paradigms</em>. Our technology stack
      includes <b>Microsoft Azure</b>, <b>Kubernetes</b>, <b>.NET Core</b> and a suite of containerized
      microservices—each chosen to optimize scalability, resilience, and performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at <a href="https://www.jamix.com/" target="_blank">Jamix</a> , I continue to lead within the <b>.NET and Azure cloud
        ecosystem</b>, leveraging the latest in development tooling and architectural best practices. My focus remains
      on building scalable, maintainable, and intelligent systems—especially where AI can empower teams and transform
      how we work. A strong focus has also been placed on <em>AI integration</em>, enhancing operational intelligence
      and accelerating productivity across products and processes.
    </p>

    <h3>Personal Attributes</h3>

    <p>
      I’m known for being <b>tenacious yet fair</b>—someone who never settles for the status quo when there's a better
      path forward. I consistently advocate for innovative approaches, continuous improvement, and delivering long-term
      value through smart technology choices. My mindset is rooted in <em>high performance</em>, <em>collaboration</em>,
      and <em>future-oriented development</em>.
